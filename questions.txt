Assignment 5 Part 2

Modify this file to add answers to the questions below.

Most questions below refer to the Graph.pdf file included with the starter code for this assignment.
Graph.pdf shows the same graph used in part 1 of this assignment.
That graph is referred to as G in this document.

For questions 1 to 6 below answer TRUE or FALSE.

Q1.  Graph G is a digraph.
	FALSE

Q2.  Graph G is acyclic.
	FALSE

Q3.  Graph G is a weighted graph.
	TRUE

Q4.  Graph G is a complete graph.
	FALSE

Q5.  In graph G, vertex 1 (Aberdeen) is reachable from vertex 4 (Kennewick).
	TRUE

Q6.  Graph G is a connected graph.
	TRUE

For questions 7 to 10 below provide short answers.

Q7.  What is the cardinality of the vertex set (|V|) in graph G?

	The cardinality of the vertex set in graph G is 10, because there are 10 vertices in the graph.

Q8.  List the vertices that are adjacent to vertex 9 (Tacoma) in graph G.

	The vertices that are adjacent to vertex are vertex 5, vertex 7, and vertex 10.
	This is because there's an edge connecting each to vertex 9.

Q9.  What is the in-degree of vertex 8 (Spokane) in graph G?

	The in-degree of vertex 8 in Graph G is 3.

Q10. What is the cost of the simple path {7, 6, 1} in graph G?

	79 + 95 = 174
	The cost of the simple path {7, 6, 1} in graph G is 174.

Questions 11 - 14 refer to DFS and BFS

Q11. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a depth first search (DFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle).
You may show either the node numbers or the city names.

	DFS order:
	Seattle
	Bellingham
	Port Angeles
	Aberdeen
	Olympia
	Tacoma
	Yakima
	Kennewick
	Spokane
	Colville

Q12. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of DFS? 

	The data structure that is used in the implementation of DFS is a Stack.

Q13. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a breadth first search (BFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle).
You may show either the node numbers or the city names.

	BFS order:
	Seattle
	Bellingham
	Port Angeles
	Spokane
	Tacoma
	Aberdeen
	Colville
	Yakima
	Olympia
	Kennewick

Q14. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of BFS?

	The data structure that is used in the implementation of BFS is a Queue.
	
Question 15 and 16 below refer to the starter code provide with this assignment.

Q15. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the minimalPath() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.

	The purpose of the minimalPath() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph is to get the cheapest path (shortest path) between a starting vertex and an end vertex. This method is useful to find the cheapest path for any 2 vertices in Graph G.

Q16. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the floydShortestPaths() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.

	The purpose of the floydShortestPaths() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph is to get all the shortest distance paths and the data is stored in a 2D array. This method is useful for finding the diameter of the graph.

For questions 17 through 20, match the name of the algorithm to the problem in graph theory it is designed to solve (from the A to F list below).
